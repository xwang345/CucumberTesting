1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

	- I finished this test within 2 hours. If I have more time, I would create a page object class that only store the page elements. the steps file can call the page object call to retrieve the element. Futhermore, I could also wirte error handle fuction that to handle the falied test cases.

2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
	- Automatically perform regression tests on new versions of the program

	- You can perform tests that are difficult or impossible to perform manually, such as stress testing and concurrent testing.

	- saving time and money

	- When I executing automated testing, first determine whether this project is suitable for automated testing, then do a requirements analysis of the project, specify a test plan, set up an automated testing framework, design test cases, execute tests, and evaluate

3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
	- In my previous 8 months coop term, I join project refactor team to refactor old project's code.  

4. How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
	- When browsing the website, we often see a wide range of elements or features, but their functions are the same, and too many similar options will only increase users' confusion. If you find that your site has the same functionality in different styles, consider redesigning your UI to integrate similar functionality.
